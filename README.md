# RailsHelpers

A bunch of code that I like to have in my Rails apps. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rails_helpers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails_helpers

See the [wiki](https://github.com/keichan34/rails_helpers/wiki) for documentation, usage, and examples.

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
